					<span class="question">You're my undergraduate faculty advisor, what does this mean?</span>
					The CS department has two types of advisors available to you. A "faculty advisor"
					and an "academic advisor" (I know that's confusing). The roles of these are explained
					on these pages: <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/current-students/undergraduates/advising/your-academic-advisors/">Academic Advisors</a>
					and <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/current-students/undergraduates/advising/advising-faq/ ">Faculty Advisors</a>
				</div>
				
				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">I have an urgent advising question, should I email you?</span>
					If you have general registration questions, degree questions, or anything
					administrative, you usually want an academic advisor, and you can either
					email <b>csug@gmu.edu</b> for help or book an in-person meeting with an advisor
					(instructions are on the <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/advising/undergraduate-advising/">Undergraduate Student Advising</a>
					page).
				</div>
				
				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">I <i>need</i> to get into [class] this semester, can you make that happen?</span>
					Unfortunately, due to departmental policy, I cannot override anyone into
					the introductory or core courses (such as CS112, CS211, CS310, CS483, etc.).
					Please contact the CS office (<b>csug@gmu.edu</b>) if you want to request an override.
				</div>
				
				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">Can I just stop by to introduce myself and/or chat?</span>
					Yep! Feel free to swing by office hours, they're listed on the
					<a href="index.html">homepage</a>. If you stop by randomly, I might not
					be in my office or might not be able to chat right then, but you can
					always try :)

				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">I need to see you for CS330 advising, how do I do this?</span>
					I always do CS330 advising in person, so just check out the <a href="index.html">homepage</a>
					section above for how to meet with me.
				</div>
				
				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">What should I bring for CS330 advising?</span>
					You need to bring a printed-out and completed CS330 advising form. Please
					write down the course names not just the numbers!
				</div>
				
				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">How long will CS330 advising take?</span>
					If you don't have any questions and you've planned your next two semesters
					carefully, it can take as little as 15 minutes. However, in my experience,
					most CS330 advising takes around 30 minutes.
				</div>
				
				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">My faculty advisor doesn't answer their email, will you be my advisor?</span>
					Advising duties in the department are distributed amongst the faculty to avoid hundreds
					of students asking the "one professor who answers emails" to do everything :)
					If you're having trouble contacting your faculty advisor, especially for CS330 advising,
					please reach out to the CS department (<b>csug@gmu.edu</b>) and let them know.
					Usually they can track down your wayward advisor for you, but if you have some other issue
					with your faculty advisor, it's best to get that mediated by someone in more authority
					than me, so also let the CS department know if that's happening. If push comes to shove,
					you can ask the CS office to reasign you to another advisor, but you probably won't be
					able to choose (and I can't "ask for you").

				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">I have [a serious situation] affecting my semester, what should I do?</span>
					The first thing (and this is very important) is that you need to remember that you are
					almost certainly <i>not</i> the first student to be in your situation.
					Depression, anxiety, financial issues, loss of a loved one, basically anything
					that can happen to a person has happened to many, many other students before.
					This means that there are lots of people who can help you on a college campus.
					<p>As a person who suffered from severe depression for a long time, the best
					general advice I can give is to reach out as soon as you realize you need help,
					that way you can get support as soon as possible. Don't try to
					tough it out by yourself, that isn't necessary, you're going through enough already.</p>
					<p>See below for specific situations, or use this list for general help:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="http://ssac.gmu.edu/">
								Student Support and Advocacy Center (SSAC)
							</a> - offers one-on-one consultations and resources in
							the areas of interpersonal violence, personal wellness,
							and alcohol/drug abuse. They also can direct you to many,
							many other campus resources.
							<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#880000">If you don't know
							who to contact, these people can help!</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://caps.gmu.edu/">
								Counseling and Support Services (CAPS)
							</a> - offers individual and/or group counseling, workshops
							and community education programs
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">The Office of Disability 
							Services</a> - handles short and long term disability
							accommodations.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="https://firstgen.gmu.edu">First-Gen+ Center</a>
							- offers a lot of support options for first-generation students
							and students with issues that commonly affect first-gen students
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="https://ombuds.gmu.edu/services-and-programs/how-schedule">University Ombudsperson</a>
							- offers an independent, informal, and confidential resource
							for discovering university resources and providing informal
							mediation and conflict resolution.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="https://learningservices.gmu.edu">Learning Services</a>
							- offers a lot of support options for things like time management,
							test taking skills, college reading skills, etc.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">I'm not sure who to contact, what should I do?</span>
					My #1 recommendation is <a href="http://ssac.gmu.edu/">SSAC</a>. They're a
					great group of people who know all the university resources and can quickly
					direct you to what you need. Other resources I specifically know about are
					below:

				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">How can I take [a few days] off to handle something?</span>
					[Examples: car accidents, very sick relatives, going to a funeral.]
					For this type of situation, the most common thing to do is just (1) document what
					is happening and (2) talk to your individual professors. Your professors will 
					almost always be easier to talk to if you do (1) before (2).
					<p>That said, keep an eye on your "short-term" issue in case it begins turning
					into a long-term issue, e.g. managing a broken arm  a car accident, becoming
					a long-term care provider for a family member, greif and depression after a loss,
					etc. See next question if that happens.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">I need to take [a week or more] off, what should I do?</span>
					There are several options, but the first thing you need to decide is if you <i>want</i>
					to continue your studies <i>while</i> dealing with your situation. It's often a relief 
					in some cases to remember you don't have to do both! Many students take a semester
					off, or even a leave of absense because of outside circumstances. That's not strange!
					<ul>
						<li><b>If you want to also continue your coursework...</b> sit down and discuss the situation with
							someone (I'm happy to do this with you, and there are also organizations on campus
							such as <a href="http://ssac.gmu.edu/">SSAC</a> and <a href="http://caps.gmu.edu/">CAPS</a>).
							Either way, explain to someone you trust (1) the situation and (2) your plan for how to
							continue school. Next, talk to your professors about your situation or talk to one of
							the campus organizations about talking to your professors for/with you (many of them will
							do that!). Listen to their advice about getting through the semester.</li>
						<li><b>If you want withdraw from the semester...</b> If you are having any sort of medical
							situation (including mental health) or other extreme circumstance that affects your semester,
							CEC has a semester withdrawal policy for such situations
							(<a href="https://cec.gmu.edu/academics/current-student-resources/current-student-forms-and-applications">
							"withdraw from a course due to a non-academic, extraordinary circumstance that is verifiable with documentation"
							</a>. Scroll down to "Withdrawal Request". There are two PDFs with full instructions. 
							This type of withdrawal is different from selective withdrawal; it doesn't get entered
							into your transcript as a W, and it can be used for some (or all) of your classes in
							a semester.</li>
						<li><b>If you want to take even longer... </b> If you do decide to go with a
							leave of absence, it works a little differently for international students
							and domestic students, here is some information on it:
								<ul>
									<li><a href="https://registrar.gmu.edu/forms/">Leave of Absence form</a> [domestic and international students]</li>
									<li><a href="https://registrar.gmu.edu/before-leaving-mason/">Before you leave Mason page</a> [domestic and international students]</li>
									<li><a href="https://oips.gmu.edu/leave-of-absence/">OIPS Leave of Absence page</a> [international students]</li>
									<li>Note: The "Academic Advisor" on the leave of absence form is the person on the other end of <b>csug@gmu.edu</b></li>

				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">Will you write me a recommendation for a UTA position?</span>
					If you (1) took and completed a class with me <i>recently</i>, (2) did well in
					that class (generally an A or A+), <i>and</i> (3) want to be a UTA for a class
					I regularly teach, then "yes" if you do the following things:</p>
					<p>(1) Complete <a href="./RecommendationForm-UTA-Raven.docx">this form</a> which gives me information on how to submit the recommendation, permission to discuss your grades, etc.</p>
					<p>(2) Email me to request the recommendation and attach the completed form</p>
					<p>(3) Meet with me in-person (during the semester) or on Zoom (over break) to discuss the recommendation and make sure you know what you're getting into :)</p>
					<p>Note: You can submit UTA applications before my recommendation goes
					in, so it's ok if you need to do your paperwork out-of-sync of our
					conversations.</p>
					<br />
				</div>
				
				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">Will you write me a recommendation for an internship?</span>
					If you have worked for me, usually the answer is yes! Please follow the steps below:</p>
					<p>(1) Complete <a href="./RecommendationForm-Raven.docx">this form</a> which gives me information on how to submit the recommendation, permission to discuss your grades, etc.</p>
					<p>(2) Email me to request the recommendation and attach the completed form</p>
					<p>(3) Meet with me in-person (during the semester) or on Zoom (over break) to discuss the recommendation and make sure you know what you're getting into :)</p>
					<p>If you have only
					been my student, then the answer is "maybe". First, you need to have
					<i>completed</i> the class with me, I cannot give recommendations to "active"
					students in my classes. So, if you are currently taking a class with me, you'll
					need to wait until after the course grades are submitted. Second, like
					with recommendations for UTA positions, you	need to have had a class with 
					me <i>recently</i> and you have to have done well in that class (generally an
					A or A+). If that sounds like you, follow the steps above!</p>
					<br />
				</div>
					
				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">Will you write me a recommendation letter for a job or provide a professional reference?</span>
					If you have worked for me, usually the answer is yes, shoot me an email! But I can't do this
					for people I have only known as a student. Professional references
					should always be from people you've worked with "professionally", and
					that usually isn't the case for students unless they have also been a 
					teaching assistant or taken some other paid position with me. <br /><br />
				</div>
					
				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">Will you write me a recommendation for the accelerated MS at GMU?</span>
					I don't need to! Your "recommender" is listed on the CS Department's
					<a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/current-students/bachelorsaccelerated-masters/">
					Accelerated Master's page</a> under "How to apply".
					<br /><br />
				</div>
				
				<div class="question-block">
					<span class="question">Will you write me a recommendation letter for grad school (at GMU or elsewhere)?</span>
					<p>Maybe... 
					I'm always flattered when students think of me for this, but I want to
					make sure you get the most out of your graduate school recommendations.
					When applying to grad school the general preference order for recommendations
					is:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>[Best]</b> Someone who knows you well, is in your intended subject area, and has worked with you outside the classroom.</li>
						<li>Someone who knows you well and is in your intended subject area (but maybe hasn't worked with you outside the classroom).</li>
						<li>Someone who knows you well and has worked with you outside the classroom (but maybe is in a different subject area).</li>
						<li>Someone who knows you well (but hasn't worked with you outside the classroom and isn't in your intended subject area).</li>
						<li>Someone in your subject area who you've been working with recently (though they may not know you well yet)</li>
						<li><b>[Least-Best]</b> Someone in your subject area.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>And then to complicate all this, when applying to graduate schools, you
					want to look for someone who is a "tenured" or "tenure-track" faculty member
					(that's faculty that don't have "instructor" or "teaching" after their title
					here: <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/directory/by-category/faculty/">CS Faculty Page</a>).
					Those faculty are research-oriented (rather than teaching-oriented) and their
					recommendations "look much better" to most graduate admission committees.</p>
					<p>So the first thing we need to do is brainstorm better options than me on
					this scale before deciding that I'm your best option... So you ask yourself:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Do I know any of my professors well? (For example, worked with them on a summer project. It's not uncommon for undergrads to say "no", so don't worry if that's your answer.).</li>
						<li>Do I know any of my professors in my subject area somewhat well? (For example, you took multiple classes with them.)</li>
						<li>Have I taken any "interesting"/"advanced" classes in the last semester or two? Were any of those faculty in the area I want to work in?</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Now, after all that, if you think I'm your best option:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Complete <a href="./RecommendationForm-Raven.docx">this form</a> which gives me information on how to submit the recommendation, permission to discuss your grades, etc.</li>
						<li>Email me to request the recommendation and attach the completed form</li>
						<li>Meet with me to discuss the recommendation either in-person or over Zoom (let me know which you'd prefer in your email)</li>
					</ol>
					<p>I'm also happy to meet just to discuss the above advice or help you brainstorm options!</p>
